# AGENTS.md — furqan.today

Quran-memorization platform. This file is the contract for every AI agent (Claude Code, opencode/GLM)
in this repo. Read it before any change. `CLAUDE.md` symlinks here, so both tools share one source of truth.

**Stack:** Next.js App Router · TypeScript (strict) · Tailwind · Supabase (Postgres/Auth/RLS/Storage) ·
Stripe · Daily.co · Bunny CDN · Sentry · n8n · PWA · full RTL/Arabic · Vercel.

**Heads-up:** this repo runs a modified/canary Next.js — APIs may differ from your training data.
Check `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before using an unfamiliar Next API.

## 1 · The Golden Rule (non-negotiable)

Judge every plan, edit, and review **through three lenses at once**. Fail one → not done.

| Lens | Owns |
|------|------|
| 🛠 Full-stack engineer | Next.js/TS/Supabase correctness, security, performance, tests |
| 📖 Quran teacher | text integrity, exact `surah:ayah`, tajweed, pedagogy |
| 🎓 Teaching-platform expert | learner UX, RTL/Arabic, motivation, accessibility |

Name the lens behind each non-trivial decision in plans and PRs.

## 2 · Quran integrity — highest priority

- Quran text and surah/ayah facts are **never generated, edited, or "corrected"** by a model. The canonical structural reference is `src/lib/quran/` (`surahs.ts`, `ayah-counts.ts`), mirrored to the `quran_surahs_reference` table — read from there; never hardcode counts elsewhere. Any rendered ayah text must come only from a verified source, never a model.
- `surah:ayah` must be exact; validate ranges against `src/lib/quran/ayah-counts.ts` — already enforced by the `student_progress_ayah_range_guard` migration. Never bypass that guard.
- Preserve tashkeel, tajweed marks, and waqf signs byte-for-byte.
- Speech→text checks compare *against* canonical text; ASR output is never stored as a Quran source.
- Unsure on a fiqh/tajweed point → flag for human review, don't guess.

## 3 · Security — hard lines

- RLS on every table; never disable it; new tables ship their policies in the same migration.
- Service-role key is **server-only**. Never in a client component, `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, or logs.
- `userId` comes from the authenticated session, **never** from request input.
- Validate every external input with zod at route handlers, server actions, and webhooks.
- n8n webhooks handle non-2xx, timeouts, and retries explicitly.
- Keep CSP tight; never leak the internal vendor map in headers. No secrets in git (`.env*` untracked).

```ts
// ✗ trusts the client, bypasses RLS
const { userId } = input
// ✓ authoritative identity, RLS enforced
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
```

### 3.1 · Server-only secrets (env-var table)

Every secret has a paired env var and is **never** `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` or logged. Secrets live in `.env.local` (gitignored) for local dev and in the Vercel project env for deploy.

| Env var | Scope | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | server-only | bypasses RLS — never in a client component |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | server-only | Stripe SDK key (`sk_test_…` / `sk_live_…`). Read by `src/lib/stripe/client.ts`. Mode is purely env-driven (FR-019) — no `if (test)` branch. |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | server-only | `whsec_…` signing secret; used by `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` to verify the **raw** body before any DB read/write (fail-closed 400). Get it from `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook` locally. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | public | Supabase project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | public | app origin (checkout/portal return URLs) |

## 4 · Code conventions

- TypeScript strict; no `any`; no `@ts-ignore` without a one-line reason.
- Prefer Server Components; reach for Client Components only when interactivity needs it.
- **Typed event names only** — `FurqanEvent` (from `src/lib/automation/emit.ts`), no raw strings:

```ts
// ✗ emitEvent('progress.recorded' as any, ...)      // bypasses type check
// ✓ emitEvent('progress.recorded', ...)             // FurqanEvent = keyof WEBHOOK_ROUTES
```

- Progress is **merged, never overwritten** — never silently lose, reset, or overstate memorization.
  Write tests for the scheduler.
- Every component must render correctly in Arabic RTL — test it, don't assume.

## 5 · Commands

Confirm exact names against `package.json` first.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev               # next dev
npx tsc --noEmit          # typecheck — MUST pass before "done" (no script)
npm run lint              # eslint — MUST pass
npm run build             # next build
npm run test:unit         # vitest — fast; run per task
npm test                  # playwright e2e — slower; before merge
npm run db:types          # regenerate Supabase types after a migration
npm run sb:advisors       # Supabase security/perf advisors (security lens)

supabase start
supabase db diff -f <name>   # never hand-edit the DB outside migrations
supabase migration up
```

## 6.1 · Agent navigation & token efficiency

Read this before exploring — it saves humans and agents from re-deriving the map.

**Large files — never read wholesale (query a symbol or a narrow range instead):**
- `src/types/database.ts` (~6.8k lines) — a **hand-corrected** types layer, NOT a stale dup of the generated file. Read only the alias section at the end (`SessionType`, `Profile`, …). Never collapse/blind-regen it — see `specs/026-database-types-drift-guard/spec.md`.
- `src/types/supabase.generated.ts` (~7.4k lines) — raw codegen; only the client reads it as `{ Database }`.
- `src/lib/dashboard-queries.ts` (~1.7k lines) — legacy god module; the per-screen read bundles live in `src/lib/views/{student,teacher}-dashboard.ts` (injected client = test seam).

**Symptom → where to look:**
- billing / checkout / subscription → `src/lib/domains/billing/**`. The webhook route (`src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`) is a thin verify+dispatch shell; handlers are in `webhook-handlers.ts`.
- booking allowed? credits/paywall? → `src/lib/domains/booking/actions.ts` — fail-closed active-package precondition (a subscription grants the package; UI paywall is a UX layer over this).
- a dashboard read → `src/lib/views/*-dashboard.ts`.
- teacher-dashboard server actions → `src/lib/actions/teacher-{booking,session}.ts`, re-exported via the `app/teacher/dashboard/actions.ts` barrel (the barrel carries **no** `"use server"` — leaf files own it; see below).
- why did a widget fail? → `logError` tags every failure with `route` + `widget`; grep the tag.

**Verify before "done":** run `npm run build`, not just `tsc`. `tsc` does not model the server/client boundary, so it passes while Turbopack fails (e.g. a `"use server"` re-export barrel dropping a client reference). CI's coverage gate also excludes `src/app/api/**` — relocating code into `src/lib` can drop coverage below threshold.

## 7 · Code intelligence (GitNexus)

GitNexus is the canonical navigation layer (MCP tools). **Required:**

- Before editing a symbol → `gitnexus_impact({target, direction:"upstream"})`; report blast radius;
  **stop and warn** on HIGH/CRITICAL risk.
- Explore with `gitnexus_query` instead of grep; full symbol context via `gitnexus_context`.
- Rename only with `gitnexus_rename` (never find-and-replace).
- Before commit → `gitnexus_detect_changes()`. If the index is stale → `npx gitnexus analyze`.
- Deep guides live in `.claude/skills/gitnexus/`.

## 8 · Dual-agent workflow (speckit)

Handoff lives in `specs/<NNN>-<feature>/` (`spec.md` → `plan.md` → `tasks.md`).

1. **Architect (Claude):** write/refine spec → plan → tasks through the three lenses. No code.
2. **Builder (opencode/GLM):** execute `tasks.md` in order; `gitnexus_impact` before edits; run
   typecheck + lint + tests per task; don't expand scope — stop and list any deviation.
3. **Reviewer (Claude):** diff vs `tasks.md` + the three lenses → return a fix checklist. No edits.

Commit the plan first; commit between handoffs; one agent edits at a time.

## 9 · Never

Modify Quran text · disable or bypass RLS · expose the service-role key client-side · trust `userId`
from input · commit secrets or `.env*` · edit a symbol without `gitnexus_impact` · mark work "done"
with a failing typecheck, lint, or test.

---

## 10 · PR workflow rules

These apply every time an agent creates or prepares a PR:

1. **Always branch from `origin/main`, never local `main`.**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git checkout -b <branch-name> origin/main
   ```
   Branching from local `main` risks creating a PR that is already behind `origin/main`, forcing a mandatory update before merge.

2. **Always rebase onto `origin/main` before pushing.**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```
   Run this immediately before `git push` (and before `gh pr create`). This ensures the branch includes the latest `origin/main` commits and satisfies GitHub's "require branch to be up to date" protection rule — avoiding a blocked merge after CI has already run.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

This environment runs the app in **development mode** against a **local Supabase
stack** (Docker). The update script only runs `npm install`; everything below is
started/applied manually per session and is **not** in the update script.

### Toolchain
- **Node 24** is required (`package.json` `engines`). The VM's daemon node is v22
  and sits first in a fresh shell's `PATH`; the agent's `~/.bashrc` prepends the
  nvm Node 24 bin so interactive shells get the right version. If `node -v` shows
  v22, run `export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v24.16.0/bin:$PATH"`.
- Docker, the `supabase` CLI, and `psql` are installed in the VM image (not via
  npm). Docker has no systemd here — start the daemon manually if it is not
  running: `sudo bash -c 'nohup dockerd >/var/log/dockerd.log 2>&1 &'` then
  `sudo chown "$USER" /var/run/docker.sock` (daemon uses the `fuse-overlayfs`
  storage driver with the containerd snapshotter disabled — see
  `/etc/docker/daemon.json`).

### Start the backend + DB (per session)
1. `export SUPABASE_AUTH_SMTP_PASS=dummy` (config.toml interpolates this; the
   value is unused locally — local mail goes to Mailpit at `http://127.0.0.1:54324`).
2. `supabase start` — boots Postgres/Auth/Storage. Studio: `http://127.0.0.1:54323`.
3. `bash scripts/dev-local-db-bootstrap.sh` — builds the **full schema**. This is
   required: the repo has **no single replayable baseline**, so plain
   `supabase db reset` / `supabase db push` fails on a fresh DB with
   `function is_admin() does not exist`. The script layers
   `src/lib/supabase/schema.sql` (V8 baseline) → `src/lib/supabase/migrations/v9..v16`
   (legacy) → `supabase/migrations/*` (timestamped). It is safe to re-run (it
   resets the DB). See the script header for the local-only workarounds it applies.

### Env + run the app
- `.env.local` points at the local stack (URL `http://127.0.0.1:54321`, plus the
  static local anon/service_role JWT keys, which are the same on every local
  Supabase install). It is gitignored; recreate it from `supabase status` if missing.
- `npm run dev` → `http://localhost:3000` (Turbopack).

### Standard commands (already documented; see `package.json` / `README.md`)
- Lint: `npm run lint` · Unit tests: `npm run test:unit` (Vitest, ~510 pass).
- E2E (`npm test`, Playwright) needs browsers first: `npx playwright install`
  (skipped at install time via `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1`).

### Gotchas / known non-issues
- **BotID & auth rate limiting are skipped** unless `process.env.VERCEL` is set,
  so local register/login works without bot tokens. Email confirmation is off
  (`config.toml`), so new accounts can log in immediately.
- **New students are intentionally redirected** from `/student/dashboard` to the
  onboarding teacher-selection page (`/student/teachers?new=1`) until they pick a
  teacher. This is by design, not a bug.
- The DB starts with **no seeded teachers/content**, so browse/list pages show
  empty states. Tables like `blog_posts` / `contact_submissions` are not created
  locally (they came from pre-v9 originals absent from the repo); the blog/contact
  marketing pages are not exercisable locally but core flows are unaffected.
- A pre-existing client-side React warning ("Rendered more hooks than during the
  previous render") can appear on some `/student/*` pages; pages still render and
  return 200. This is app code, unrelated to environment setup.
- First request to a route compiles on demand (dev mode) and can take several
  seconds; this can briefly show a browser "page couldn't load" before it loads.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **furqan** (9520 symbols, 19059 relationships, 300 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? `npx gitnexus analyze` (npm 11 crash → `npm i -g gitnexus`; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows. For regression review, compare against the default branch: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({search_query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.
- For security review, `explain({target: "fileOrSymbol"})` lists taint findings (source→sink flows; needs `analyze --pdg`).

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
